                    Designation of the responsible organization
                    The responsible data processing unit on this site is:
                    domaine les enfants sauvage
                    Nikolaus et Carolin Bantlin
                    10 - 12, rue Gilbert Salamo
                    11510 Fitou
                    France

                    The responsible organization, alone or together with others, decide on the purposes and means of processing personal data (such as names, contact details, etc.).


                    Revocation of your consent to data processing
                    Only with your express consent are certain data processing processes possible. A revocation of your consent already given is possible at any time. For the revocation is sufficient an informal message by e-mail. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.


                    Right to lodge a complaint with the competent authority
                    As a data subject, in the event of a breach of data protection law, you have a right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority. The competent data protection supervisory authority is the data protection officer of the federal state in which our company is headquartered. The following link provides a list of data protection officers and their contact details: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.


                    Right to data portability
                    You have the right to have data that we process on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically to you or to third parties. The layout is made in a machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of the data to another responsible person, this will only be done insofar as this is technically possible.
                    Right to information, correction, blocking, deletion
                    You have the right at any time within the framework of the applicable legal provisions to provide free information about your stored personal data, the source of the data, their recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to rectification, deletion or deletion of this data. In this regard and also for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can always contact us via the contact options in the imprint.
